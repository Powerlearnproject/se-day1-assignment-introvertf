#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles,methods, and tools to the development and maintenance of high-quality software.
Importance of software engineering includes:
reliability which ensures software performs as expected without bias especially for critical applications like healthcare ,finance. 
efficiency, this helps to optimize developer workflow while maintaining high quality standards.
 scalability and flexibility this is very crucial because it ensures that the system can handle an increased load without affecting performance.
 security where implementation of protection practice like authentication, authorization and encryption to secure users information.
 
Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1.Development of programming languages(1960s)  2.The advent of structured programming(1970s)  3.The rise of agile methodologies(2000s)

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

Planning - identify the software requirement or purpose and scope.
Requirement analysis -it involves identifying the final user specification. 
Design - building the framework and user interface which are high -level. 
Coding - converting software design into tangible code.
Testing - examine the software for any bugs and glitches.
Deployment - Releasing the software to users or customers.
Maintenance - This is providing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Waterfall methodology
-Linear and sequential, each phase is completed before moving on. 
- there is Low flexibility,
- changes are hard to incorporate once a phase is complete.
- Customer feedback comes late, after the product is developed.
- Testing is done at the end of the development process.

Waterfall methodology is applicable in small Projects with Fixed Scope: For smaller projects with a limited scope and clear objectives, Waterfall can be efficient.

Agile methodology
- Iterative and incremental, with multiple cycles (sprints). 
- High flexibility, adapts to changing requirements. 
- Regular customer feedback is incorporated into every sprint. 
- Testing is continuous and done after each iteration.

Agile methodology is applicable in dynamic Projects: Projects in fast-paced industries (e.g., tech startups, software development) where requirements frequently change benefit from Agileâ€™s flexibility.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

a.)A software engineer is responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions. They are responsible for maintaining and updating software to keep it functional.They report to the project manager.

b.)A quailty Assurance Engineer ensures quality by designing and executing test plans. They also collaborate with stakeholders to understand and clarify software requirement.They create development standards and procedures for the programmers to follow, confirm that the software meets the requirement before deployment, analyse the product to identify bugs and suggest changes to make them more efficient, develop and execute automation scripts using open source tools.

c.)A Project Manager oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.
 - assembles and lead the software development team.
 - discuss the project and it's requirement with the client and software developers.
 - create blueprint for the project.
 - tracking and communicating information regarding the project milestone.
 - deliver the complete software to the client and regularly check its performance.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

Importance of Integrated Devlopment Environments Include:

 - They contain many intelligent features for automatically writing or editing the source code based on the syntax and semantics of the programming language being used.
 - They can format the written text by automatically making some words bold or italic, or by using different font colors. These visual cues make the source code more readable and give instant feedback about accidental syntax errors.
- An IDE can make suggestions to complete a code statement when the developer begins typing.
- IDEs increase programmer productivity by performing repeatable development tasks that are typically part of every code change. The following are some examples of regular coding tasks that an IDE carries out.
- An IDE compiles or converts the code into a simplified language that the operating system can understand. - Some programming languages implement just-in-time compiling, in which the IDE converts human-readable code into machine code from within the application.
- The IDE allows developers to automate unit tests locally before the software is integrated with other developers' code and more complex integration tests are run.
-Debugging IDE enables a step through the code, line by line, as it runs and inspect code behavior. IDEs also integrate several debugging tools that highlight bugs caused by human error in real time, even as the developer is typing.

Version Control Systems (VCS) - are software tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time. eg Git
importance:
- Collaboration: Enables multiple developers to work on the same codebase without conflicts.
- Change Tracking: Records detailed history of changes, allowing easy analysis of each modification. 
- Branching and Merging: Supports creating branches for new features and merging them back into the main code.
- Error Recovery: Allows reverting to previous versions if new changes introduce errors

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

-rapid technological advancement places considerable pressure on software engineers to stay current.
 Solution: adopting continuous learning practices and using agile methodologies to adapt to emerging trends, keeping their skills sharp in an ever-evolving industry. 
 
-Time Constraints - Software engineering is a demanding and time-intensive field, often requiring engineers to work under high pressure to meet tight deadlines.
 Solution: adopt agile methodologies, such as Scrum, to streamline workflows by dividing large projects into manageable sprints 
 
-Limited Infrastructure - limited high-performance software engineering tools and computing platforms and inefficient data storage architectures. 
 Solution: Software engineers must rely heavily on a robust infrastructure to perform their jobs effectively.
 
-Changing Software Requirements - Software requirements are often dynamic and subject to frequent changes, making it challenging for engineers to design and develop solutions that meet users' needs while accounting for future updates and bug fixes. 
Solution: engineers can adopt approaches like agile development, which emphasizes iterative progress and adaptability, and modular design, which enables flexibility by breaking systems into manageable, independent components.

-Software Security - Programming secure software is a complex and challenging task. 
Solution: research ways to defend against hacking, malware, phishing, insider and third-party threats.

Software Accessibility and Usability - Overly complex software can frustrate or confuse users. 
Solution: Use scalable architecture, Emphasize reliability.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

-Unit tests - are close to the source of an application, They consist in testing individual methods and functions of the classes, components, or modules used by your software. 
It ensures that each unit performs its intended function correctly, isolated from other components.

 Integration tests - verify that different modules or services used by your application work well together.
 They help to ensure data flows smoothly between modules and interfaces work as expected.
 
 -System testing -Focus on the entire software system as a whole, including all functionalities and interactions.
 It help to verify that the system meets all functional and non-functional requirements, including performance, usability, and security .
 
-Acceptance tests - are formal tests that verify if a system satisfies business requirements. They require the entire application to be running while testing and focus on replicating user behaviors. 
 Whether the software meets the needs of the end-user and is ready for deployment.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

prompt engineering is the art of crafting questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models.

Importance of Prompt Engineering include:
-To improve user experience. It easy for users to obtain relevant results in the first prompt.
-To increase flexbility. A prompt engineer can create prompts with domain-neutral instructions highlighting logical links and broad patterns.

-It gives the Developer control over user's interactions with AI. Effective prompts provide intent and establish context to the large language models.



Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Draw a car.


Draw a 2023 dodge Challenger SRT Hellcat with supercharged 6.2L  V8 enginee final model year for the SRT Hellcat's 6.2-liter supercharged V8 with a range of outputs between 717 horsepower and 807 horsepower.

Clarity: The improved prompt specifies what is being asked (a coc3 dodge challenger SRT hellcat) rather than just a "car.

Specific Details: Describing the woman's appearance (upercharged 6.2L  V8 enginee final model year for the SRT Hellcat's 6.2-liter supercharged V8 with a range of outputs between 717 horsepower and 807 horsepower) 

Concise: The additional details provide a clear picture without being overly complicated, making it easier for the car lover to understand exactly what is needed.
